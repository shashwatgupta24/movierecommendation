# MOVIE RECOMMENDATION MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT
This is a movie recommendation machine learning project. A recommendation system is a platform that provides its users with various contents based on their preferences and likings. A recommendation system takes the information about the user as an input. 
This works on a collaborative filtering recommendation system or more specifically, ITEM based collaborative recommendation system.
This project uses Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib libraries of Python.
Recommendation Systems are the most popular type of machine learning applications that are used in all sectors. 
They are an improvement over the traditional classification algorithms as they can take many classes of input and provide similarity ranking based algorithms to provide the user with accurate results.
These recommendation systems have evolved over time and have incorporated many advanced machine learning techniques to provide the users with the content that they want.
The various files used in this are uploaded in the repository (u.data and u.item).
This project has been made in the Google Collab.
The project takes 'Movie 100k' dataset.
